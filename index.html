                “Whoever refuses to feed his soul is cruel.  Our soul nourishes itself through obedience to its Lord.  If you take away its nourishment, you shorten your life.”  </br>
                “They say, ‘He died.’  What does this mean?  It means, ‘He was Taken away.  The Divine Spark was Taken from him.’  Then, he is nothing.”  </br>
                “The Oneness of God is the basis of all prophetic religions.  It is the Criterion with which to distinguish a false prophet from a true one.  He who calls people to the Oneness of God calls them to the True Way and is a true emissary of God Almighty.  He who does not call them to this Way, but who calls them to another or to others, does not follow a Heavenly Way but runs after his ego.”  </br>

                “We claim existence, and we cling to this existence.  Maybe the price for it is high, very high.  It does not Matter.  We keep saying, ‘We will Pay.’”  </br>
                “Yes, I know all languages.  I understand them all.  There is also a kind of speaking without speaking, and I know what will be said before it is said.  I understand.”  </br>
                  It is the same with obedience; it is like digging in the heart.”  </br>
                “Even if you are photographed in 20,000 poses, You are still one.  Great wisdom lies in this.  To reach your one essence, you must die to yourself while you are still alive.   Die before you die', means to be in connection with the original.”  </br>

                “Doubt comes from pride.  You doubt when you are not humble enough to believe.”  </br>

                “All things except God are like shadows in a mirror.”  </br>

                “All praise, whatever its source, goes to Allah.  When I praise you, I praise your Creator.  For there is nothing praiseworthy about you, unless it comes from your Creator.”  </br>
                “We ask to be no one and nothing.  For, as long as we are someone, we are not complete.”  </br>
                “It is impossible to understand yourself.  At least, you must look into a mirror.  No one recognises the imperfections in himself.”  </br>
                “What comes first, the pearl or the shell?”  </br>
                “What shall I say about myself?  I am like the moon.  When the sun goes, the light of the moon goes.  If the light of my Master leaves me, I am in darkness.  I am nothing.  Whoever sees me as this one or that one sees me through the Light of my Master.”  </br>
