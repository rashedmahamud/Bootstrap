                    </h3>
                    “Instead of becoming an animal for this world, why don’t you come and surrender to ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib?  ’Ali ibn Abi Talib follows the way of the Owner of the Heavens and Earth, Allah (subhana wa talala).  For the sake of the Beloved of Allah, the Pride of the Universes, he (Shah Mardan) sacrifices himself for him.  He is that holy person.  That is ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib.” (April 24th, 2013)</br>
                    <h3>
                    Our Way is the Way of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib 
                    </h3>
                    “Let’s pull ourselves together.  Our way is the way of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib’s associations.  He is the Pride of Creation’s (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) cousin, who is the City of Knowledge.  He (Hz. ‘Ali) is the Door, the Door to the City of Knowledge (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam)…innal quwatalillahi jamian, when all power belongs to Allah, why are you searching for it elsewhere?  What stupidity is this? Get up! And come to the assemblies of those who are ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib’s beloved ones.  The beloved ones to the Lion of Allah.  Go to their assemblies and associations because only lions can walk with lions….if you want to be a lion, how can you walk with dogs?” (April 24th, 2013)</br>
                    <h3>
                    Instructions from ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib
                    </h3>
                    “What can we do, O ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib? ‘Make my assemblies everywhere’, he is saying.  These assemblies, Yaran-full of love-let them be everywhere in  one thousand places, in one-hundred thousand places, so people can come back to life.  So Angels can dress you with the dress of power from heavens, and dress you with the dress of mightiness, so enemies cannot look in your direction, so oppressors will look for shelter, but will not find it…” (April 24th, 2013)</br>
                    <h3>
                    Be Just, Keep the Way of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib
                    </h3>
                    “Be just, keep the way of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib.  I am ashamed to say: Keep the way of Allah (swt), but we have permission to mention ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib’s orders, and his mightiness.  Dhul Fiqar (sword) was seen in his hands, but now there are holy ones dressed with his holy rank, who follow his way (pointing at himself). Their swords are hidden for now, but tomorrow it will be out in the open.  Let’s say, “Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem“.  O ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (Shah Mardan)! How beautifully you are speaking! Ay Shah Mardan!  The people who the Lion of Allah loves, you have no fear in this life, nor in the hereafter.  You are honorable, and you are lions.” (April 24th, 2013)</br>
